## Expert RTF Editor class


</div>

### Description

This class is an RTF textbox wrapper wrriten in VB6. The class can let you write your own editors and you can control the colors of the words by using simple methods. i have seen some RTF coloring stuff in PSC but this code is different. i edit the RTF code instead of using the UGLY .selstart,.sellength,.SelColor stuff, this is the reason that this code is for advanced users as you can see it's very hard to manage the intristic RTF code but i did it !!!

anyway, this class is a LIGHT VERSION of my editors class which also supports VB LIKE INTELISENSE (working perfect)!!!!!!!!!

i didnt put the complete class because its much more hard to understand and it also uses VS FLEX GRID 7 for the intelisense and lots of guys dont have this grid so-

enjoy this code and let me know what you think about it.

P.S. im working in motorola israel, writing simulators and compilers if you do similar things and need any help - be my guest.
